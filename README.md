This repository hosts a machine learning model that classifies breast cancer cells as either Benign or Malignant. To achieve this, I implemented a Support Vector Machine algorithm that I trained to take in various features such as cell radius and perimeter, and predict a binary output. To increase accuracy to 96%, I then made use of sklearn's GridSearchCV algorithm that was instrumental in the selection of various hyper parameters such as the C, gamma, the kernel.
